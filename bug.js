The issue stems from attempting to access a Firebase Realtime Database value before the asynchronous `onValue` callback has completed.  This often manifests as `undefined` or `null` values being unexpectedly returned, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.  For example:

```javascript
const ref = firebase.database().ref('myData');
let data = ref.once('value').val(); // Incorrect:  .val() is called before data is available
console.log(data); // data will likely be undefined
```
