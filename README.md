# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Value Access Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Realtime Database interactions: attempting to access data before the asynchronous `onValue` or `once` callback has finished.  This results in unexpected `undefined` or `null` values.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when trying to directly access the value from a Firebase reference before the asynchronous operation completes.  The `once` or `on` methods are asynchronous, and the value is not immediately available.

## Bug Solution
The solution utilizes promises or async/await to properly handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase data retrieval.  The code waits for the promise to resolve before accessing the data, ensuring it is available.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase: `npm install firebase`
3. Replace placeholders in `bug.js` with your Firebase configuration.
4. Run `node bug.js` to observe the error.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.
